            The conditions described herein apply to consultations with all
            practitioners employed by Robin’s Perfect Health Pty Ltd.
          </p>

          <h2 className={"font-semibold py-4"}>
            1. ROBIN’S PERFECT HEALTH IS A CASH PRACTICE:
          </h2>
          <p>
            1.1. Robin’s Perfect Health is not contracted to any medical aid
            and operates exclusively as a cash practice. Patients may submit
            invoices for reimbursement by their medical aid, but no warranty
            is made by the Robin’s Perfect Health for medical aid
            reimbursement.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.2. Medical aid coverage is an agreement
            between the patient and the provider and is entirely independent
            of Robin’s Perfect Health and its policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.3. We bill consultations at a rate in excess of NHRPL tariffs, so medical
            aids may not cover the costs of consultation in full.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.4. While the practice may assist in submitting the invoice to
            Medical Aids on behalf of the patient, it remains the patient’s
            sole responsibility to follow up with their medical aid regarding
            reimbursement.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.5. All patients must complete our Patient Information form before
            seeing the practitioner. It is your responsibility to ensure that we
            have your correct information. Robin’s Perfect Health takes no
            responsibility for non-payment by medical aid schemes due to the
            submission of incorrect or incomplete information.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.6. Under no circumstances will Robin’s Perfect Health backdate
            invoices for the purposes of claiming from medical aid.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.7. We will submit your claims and assist you in any way we can to
            help get your claims paid. Your medical scheme administrator may request
            information directly from you. Your failure to comply in good time
            with your medical scheme’s request may result in your claim’s denial.
          </p>

          <h2 className={"font-semibold py-4"}>
            2. UPDATED CHANGE OF INFORMATION:
          </h2>
          <p>
            2.1. It is the patient’s responsibility to update your information
            whenever you have a change in address, employment, medical scheme
            plan, option, benefits, etc. Failure to update information will
            not exempt the patient from responsibility for all outstanding
            accounts held with Robin’s Perfect Health.
          </p>
          <h2 className={"font-semibold py-4"}>

          <p>
            3.1. Payment is expected in full at the time of your visit. We will
            accept cash or credit card. EFTs are only accepted for product
            orders for delivery or by prior arrangement with the Robin’s Perfect
            Health management. Robin’s Perfect Health reserves the right to deny
            the option to pay by EFT.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.2. The consultation fee DOES NOT include additional finger-prick
            blood tests, urine dipstick tests, or injectables. These tests are
            optional, and the patient is liable for all additional tests
            accepted.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.3. Different consultation fees apply to Initial Consultations,
            Follow Ups, and Specialised Diagnostic Test consultations, such as
            Organic Acid Analysis. Ensure that you are familiar with the cost of
            your consultation before you arrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.4. A receipt detailing the services and products rendered on the
            date of service will be issued to the patient immediately after
            their consultation.

          <h2 className={"font-semibold py-4"}>
            4. NO SHOW POLICY:
          </h2>
          <p>
            4.1. A cancellation fee amounting to the full consultation price is

          <p>
            4.2. If you miss 3 or more visits without
            canceling or rescheduling 12 hours in advance you may be blocked
            from our practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3. Consideration of this cancellation fee will be given where
            patients have endured exceptional circumstances relating to their
            missed appointment entirely at the discretion of Robin’s Perfect
            Health Management.
          </p>

            or other parties for payment of bills.

            emergencies we may run late in attending to your scheduled
            appointment time. This is an unavoidable feature of medical rooms
            where serious and difficult medical cases are handled. We will do
            our best to let you know (at the telephone numbers you have provided
            to us) when we are running behind schedule. Having an appointment
            begin late does not exempt you from payment in full for services and

          <p>
            7.2. Visits that begin late due to a patient’s late arrival will be

            lost due to late arrival.

            other health information. To submit an account to a medical scheme

            discloses information to the scheme about your health condition.
